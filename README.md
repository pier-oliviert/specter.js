# specter.js

Specter is a testing utility that compares the DOM before and after a JS operation was done to make sure that what is rendered from JS is what is expected.

This DOM-diffing operation allows to quickly see when a change made to the JS stack has changed the expected output. Also, because the testing operation is done on the DOM output, this library is framework agnostic.
